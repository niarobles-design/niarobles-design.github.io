## Description

This is an advice generator app that uses the Advice Slip API to generate random quotes of advice.

This project is a simple demostration of 3rd-party APIs consuming.

## My process

My first step is always thinking about a proper structure that will suit the requirements of the project. I decide which will be the bigger parts of the project, and then I divide them into smaller components.

Then I write all the code logic, trying to make it as simple as possible. Once everything works, I start working on the style.
