## Logo design

Awaq ONGD is an organization that promotes initiatives to heal nature through the use of different technologies.

- I was asked to design a logo that shows that link between nature and technology.

{% include image.html image="projects/awaq-ongd-logo-and-banner/logo-variations.png" text="Logo variations with medium contrast" %}

## My process

The main challenge was to find a balance between organic shapes and geometric shapes.

My solution was to create a tree with unordered geometric shapes. This way I was able to create a technological feeling through geometric shapes while preserving an organic feeling through the general concept (a tree) and the unordered disposition of the shapes.
