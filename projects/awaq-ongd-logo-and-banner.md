## Logo design

Awaq ONGD is an organization that promotes initiatives to heal nature through the use of different technologies.

- I was asked to design a logo that shows a link between nature and technology.

### My process

The main challenge was to find a balance between organic shapes and geometric shapes.

My solution was to create a tree with unordered geometric shapes. This way I was able to create a technological feeling through geometric shapes while preserving an organic feeling through the general concept (a tree) and the unordered disposition of the shapes.

## Banner design

The organization is celebrating an International Congress which focuses on women leadership of environmental actions.

- I was asked to design a banner for the congress that shows the women strenght to lead enviromental actions.

### My process

The main challenge was, again, to find the right balance between organical shapes (nature) and geometric shapes (technology and leadership).

I quickly found that since the general perception associates soft (weak) shapes with feminity, I needed to keep those away from the concept of "women leading the way".

The result was three women designed with geometric shapes coming from a tree. To achieve a balance between organic and geometric I designed a tree that goes from geometric to organic shapes on its perimetral shapes (leaves and roots).

### A design for different screens
