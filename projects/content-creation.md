## Jellyfishes in Spain

Every summer in Spain many people complain about jellyfishes and ask for them to be "removed" from the beaches.

I designed this infographic to educate social media users about jellyfishes and how important they are for the sea.

## Endangered species

I made a drawing of a Garza Real and used it to talk about this endangered species of Spain on social media.

I made different infographic for other endangered species of Spain. This one is about la Sabina de las Dunes, and was designed to be published on the International Day of Forests.

## Pollution

I designed this infographic to educate social media users about pollution processes (like "whiting") that hurt the sea.

On the International Noise Awareness Day, I designed this infographic to raise awareness of the effects of noise on the different species that coexist with us.

## Raise awareness

Many people think environmental protection endangers the farmers' livelihoods.

I designed this infographic for the International Day of Peasants and Farmers to raise awareness about how protecting the land is protecting the farmers.
