## Create an app for a cinema that features movie trailers to help users discover interesting new and upcoming releases.

### Goal

We want to centralise the user experience on one single app. The app will feature movie trailers so users don’t have to look for them in different apps or websites.

- The **user** get the information they need fast and comfortably
- The **app** gets more engagement to better retain customers and foster loyalty

### Role and responsibilities

- User research
- User experience exploration
- Product strategy
- Product storyboards and sketches
- Competitive audit
- User flows

## Research

### User Interviews - Insights

None of the **users** use a cinema app to decide what movie they want to watch or to discover movies they might be interested in. Instead, they **rely on different sources**:

- **Social media**
- Recommendations from **friends**
- Specialized websites like **Filmaffinity**

This suggests they don’t have a direct or convenient way to access this kind of information. Even when they find a movie they’re interested in, they still need to open a cinema app to check its availability and buy the tickets.

> **"I don’t use any specific app for the purpose of discovering interesting movies, but I do use a tracking app for the movies and TV shows I watch. Sometimes, the algorithm in this app shows me a good recommendation. It’s not something I actively look for in the app, but it occasionally happens".**

**Opportunity**: we can provide users with a more centralized experience through our cinema app. Since users need to check movie availability anyway, offering an easy and comfortable experience could make us their first choice for a cinema app.

All the insights gathered from the research helped us get a clear idea of the user experience:

**The user needs an easy and comprehensive way of discovering interesting titles available at their cinema**

### Effectiveness Metrics

We will measure the app’s effectiveness by analyzing both **daily and weekly active users**, as well as the duration of **their sessions** in the app.

This data will reveal whether users find the app useful for planning their cinema experience by offering them a more centralized experience. It will also help understand if **user engagement** has increased.

Ultimately, the sales data will give us insights into **customer retention**.
