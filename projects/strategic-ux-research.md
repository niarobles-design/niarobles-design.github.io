## User needs exploration through interviews for the development of a new product: a movie trailers app for a cinema

We want to develop an app for a cinema to improve the UX for its customers, ensuring it becomes their first choice for planning a trip to the movies.

### Introduction: Product and Audience

The current app allows users to buy tickets, pick seats and see the screening catalog.

We came up with the idea of improving the app to help users choose what movie to watch. To achieve this, we started working on the idea of including movie trailers in the app so that users can easily access more information about the movies in the catalog.

- **Problem statement**: Create a movie trailers app for a cinema
- **Audience**: Cinema customers

### Research Methods

We **conducted interviews** with 5 users to better understand their needs as cinema customers. We wanted to get a clearer view of both the positive and negative aspects of their current experience and what we can build to offer them a better one.

**At this point, our main goals were to determine if our movie trailers feature would actually improve their experience and identify any other pain points we could address.**

### Interviews

Mauris velit metus, tempor gravida nulla eget, auctor accumsan tellus. Curabitur volutpat sed dolor quis tempus. In scelerisque aliquam felis at tincidunt. Proin non augue fringilla, maximus dui. Nunc ipsum nisi, fermentum sit amet volutpat cursus, sodales ac nisl. Quisque nec tellus sem.

### Personas

**Based on the interviews, we were able to create 2 personas that represents 2 different user groups.**

Building personas helped us maintain our focus on user needs. We didn't want to push the movie trailers feature just because it was our main idea for this project; we wanted to ensure the movie trailers feature was truly key for the user.
