## Create a content calendar and manage an Instagram account that previously did not follow a consistent publishing schedule

### Instagram Feed

This is how our feed looks now. With the new calendar we experimented with different aesthetics and designs for the posts until we developed a more consistent style.

### Reach Increase

{% include image.html image="projects/social-media-management/instagram-metrics.png" %}

Since our first publication on June 11th, 2024, following the new calendar and branding adjustments we have:

- Increased our reach by a 670.1%

- Boosted user interactions by a 366.7%

**We have been focusing on organic growth.**
Our goal is to gain more loyal followers and expand our reach, so we have reduced our CTAs and click encouragment.

### Fundraising

We launched a fundraising campaign supported by related organic content to help cover the shelter's water expenses.

A collaborator donated us an herb garden for cats, so we organized a raffle to raise funds for the campaing.

We supported the campaing by publishing organic content about different herbs and their benefits for cats.

To encourage participation, I also organized a challenge where I recorded myself drawing one cat for every raffle ticket sold.

We successfully reached our goal of selling 100 tickets and completed the challenge.
