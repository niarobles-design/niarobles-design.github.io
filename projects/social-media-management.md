## Create a content calendar and manage an Instagram account that previously did not follow a consistent publishing schedule

### Reach Increase

Since our first publication on June 11th, 2024, following the new calendar and branding adjustments we have:

- Increased our reach by a 566,6%

- Boosted user interactions by a 113,4%

**We have been focusing on organic growth.**
Our goal is to gain more loyal followers and expand our reach, so we have reduced our CTAs and click encouragment.

### Fundraising

We launched a fundraising campaign supported by related organic content to help cover the shelter's water expenses.

A collaborator donated us an herb garden for cats, so we organized a raffle to raise funds for the campaing.

We supported the campaing by publishing organic content about different herbs and their benefits for cats.

To encourage participation, I also organized a challenge where I recorded my self drawing one cat for every raffle ticket sold.
