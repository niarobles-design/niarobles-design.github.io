### Description

A couple is visiting the local fair when they find a claw machine full of kitty plushies. You need to catch all the plushies your partner wants to make them happy!

### Role and responsibilities

- Artist
  - Character design
  - Face expressions
  - Game items

### Character design

I was asked to design a variety of plushies with different silhouettes for the game to work. And to add difficulty for the player, I was also asked to create some other plushies with only small differences between their silhouettes.

As a result, I designed three types of kitty plushies, three different poses for every type, and 4 different accessories.

#### The result:
