## Description

Landing page with a responsive design that can be viewed on different screen sizes. It also includes hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My process

I have specially focused on accessibility and responsiveness for this design.

Usually I love working with Flexbox, but this time I wanted to use CSS Grid since it was a better option for this design.
