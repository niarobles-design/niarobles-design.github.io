# Nia Robles

## Who am I?

Hi! My name is Nia and I'm a creative designer from Spain. I mainly produce art and creative content. This covers a wide range of works, so here is a list of things I usually do:

- UI/UX Design
- Social Media Art and Visual Content
- Community Management
- Illustration
- Character Design
- Copywriting

## What's this site about?

This site is about my projects and my thoughts on creative topics: I talk about my process, my workflow, things I'm learning about, and useful resources and tips. It also tells a story: My Journey.

## What are my motivations?

I love connecting with others and feeling part of a community. I love making people laugh, and I feel so accomplished when people feel moved by my creations. Design, art, and content are the tools I found that help me best achieve this, so they naturally and genuinely make me happy.

Video games are my favourite medium, my favourite way of connecting with people, so it goes without saying that my creativity truly thrives when it comes to gaming!

## What do I like?

If you check my site, you'll soon notice how much I LOVE CATS. But other things I love are: video games, books, TV shows, and spending time in nature.
